        <h2>How the Internet Works</h2>
        <p>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other through a variety of protocols and technologies.</p>
        
        <h2>DNS (Domain Name System)</h2>
        <p>The Domain Name System is like the Internet's phonebook. It translates human-friendly domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses.</p>

        <h2>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</h2>
        <p>HTTP is the protocol used for transmitting web pages and other resources on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.</p>

        <h2>IP Address</h2>
        <p>An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network. It allows devices to find and communicate with each other on the Internet.</p>

        <h2>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h2>
        <p>A URL is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the Internet. It typically includes the protocol (e.g., http://), domain name, and path.</p>
    
        <h2>Clients and Servers</h2>
        <p>The Internet operates on a client-server model. Clients, such as your web browser, request and receive data from servers, which are powerful computers that store and deliver web content. When you enter a website's address into your browser, you're acting as a client.</p>

        <h2>Web Hosting</h2>
        <p>Web hosting involves storing the files and data of a website on a server that is connected to the Internet. Hosting providers offer various types of hosting services, including shared hosting, dedicated hosting, and cloud hosting, to make websites accessible to users worldwide.</p>

        <h2>Searching for a Website</h2>
        <p>When you search for a website like Facebook.com, your browser initiates a series of actions:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The browser checks its cache (local storage) to see if it already has a copy of the web page. If it does, it loads the page from the cache for faster access.</li>
            <li>If the page isn't in the cache or it has expired, the browser sends a request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server to translate the human-readable domain name (e.g., facebook.com) into an IP address. This IP address identifies the server where Facebook's website is hosted.</li>
            <li>Once the browser has the IP address, it sends a request to the appropriate web server (Facebook's server, in this case) over the Internet.</li>
            <li>The web server processes the request and retrieves the Facebook web page's files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.</li>
            <li>The web server then sends these files back to your browser, which renders them to display the Facebook website on your screen.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This entire process, which happens in a matter of seconds, allows you to access and interact with websites on the Internet.</p>
